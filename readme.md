# 🖼️ Fluid Grid of Random Images 🖼️

I set myself the challenge of making a fluid grid of random images which was fully responsive on any device 💻

All the images are generated on the fly using the Unsplash API and are resized using media queries. Try resizing the browser to see the fluidity of the grid 🍯

### Features 💡
- Search for any number of images (from 1 to 999!) Then press enter
- User input is fully validated with error messages
- Each random image is fetched from [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com)
- All the images load in a scrollable container
- Resize your browser to see media queries adjust the size of the images and columns per row
- Click on an image thumbnail to see full-size image
- This is made from scratch with vanilla JavaScript and CSS - no frameworks or libraries
- Made with just 80 lines of JavaScript! ⚡️
