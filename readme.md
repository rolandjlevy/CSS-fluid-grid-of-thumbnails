# 🖼️ Fluid Grid of Random Images 🖼️

I set myself the challenge of making a fluid grid of random images which is fully responsive on any device 💻

All the images are generated on the fly using the Unsplash API and are resized using media queries. Try resizing the browser to see the fluidity of the grid 🍯

### Features 💡
- Choose any number of images (from 1 to 999!) and press enter
- The input field is fully validated  with error handling
- Each random image is fetched from [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com/documentation)
- All the images load into a scrollable container
- Resize your browser to see media queries adjust the size of the images and number of columns per row
- Click on an image to see full-size image on the Unsplash website
- This is made from scratch with vanilla JavaScript and CSS - no frameworks or libraries
- All works with just 80 lines of JavaScript! ⚡️
