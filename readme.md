# CSS Fluid Grid of Random Images üñºÔ∏è

I set myself the challenge of making a fluid grid of random images which was fully responsive on any device. All the images are generated on the fly using the Unsplash API and resized using media queries. It is made purely with JavaScript and CSS - no frameworks or libraries.

### Description
- Choose any number of images, press enter
- Each random image is fetched from [Unsplash API](https://unsplash.com)
- Resize your browser to see the see how the media queries adjust the size of each image and the amount of columns in each row
- Click on an image thumbnail to see full-size image
